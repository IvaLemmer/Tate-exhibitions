	  <h1>OP ART IN FOCUS</h1>
	  <p>Until 12 July 2020</p>
	  <P>Free</p>
	  <p>Join us for a dazzling display of pioneering art. Op art- short for optical art- emerget in the 1960s. 
	  Its leading figures included Briget Riley, Jesus Rafael Soto and Victor Vasarely.
	  They combined lines, geometric shapes and eye- popping colour to create artworks that fool the eye.
	  Images could be subtitle or disorientating, giving the illusion of movement.
	  Included is a rare instalation of Jim Lambie`s Zobop which floods the entire gallery floor with a psychedelic pattern.</p>
